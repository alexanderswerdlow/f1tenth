# How to contribute

We are glad about contributions in any way, shape, or form.
If you have patches or new features, please consider creating a merge request.
We are also always happy to hear about projects in which you have implemented
your own plug-ins.


## Changes to the Core Framework

On a case-by-case basis we have to decide on whether to merge new branches
or whether to create preliminary topic branches for them.
Trivial changes are also always welcome.


## Plug-Ins

New controllers or local planners should be implemented in the form of
plug-ins that do not need extensions to the main framework.


## Reporting Issues

We appreciate every posted issue for any kind of bug, failed assertion or
usability issue, as well as in the form of ideas and suggestions.
