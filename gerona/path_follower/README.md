# Navigation: Path Follower
A package containing various path following control algorithms (controllers) for wheeled mobile robots. Each controller is thoroughly tested both in simulation and on real mobile robots.

Each controller has one or more implementations, depending on its compatibility with different kinematic configurations, where this compatibility is described as a prefix 'ackermann', 'omnidrive', etc. For instance, the orthogonal-exponential controller ('orthexp') has 3 different implementations:
* `ackermann_orthexp` (this implementation is used for car-like and bi-steerable vehicles),
* `differential_orthexp` (differential and skid-steered drives),
* `omnidrive_orthexp` (omnidirectional vehicles).

The HBZ controller has two implementations:
* `HBZ` (used for regular path following),
* `HBZ_TT` (used for target tracking, will be released soon),

where "TT" is short for "target tracking". This target tracking feature can be used for tracking of any dynamic object (e.g. another robot). We used it to follow a human jogger outdoors.

The controllers and their compatibilities with different kinematic configurations and special features are described in the next table.

Top collumns represent kinematic configurations: 
* **ackermann** (car-like, i.e. Ackermann steering vehicles), 
* **bi-steerable** (vehicles with front- and rear-wheels steering),
* **omnidrive** (omnidirectional vehicles), 
* **differential** (differential drives, i.e. unicycles), 
* **skid-steer** (skid steering), 

as well as two features:
* **target tracking** (a special feature for tracking a dynamic target, e.g. following a person),
* **reverse driving** (cabability of path following while driving backwards).

The left border rows represent different controllers, and they are listed together with the references as follows:

* `input_scaling`: A controller using a certain mathematical scaling of the input in its derivation, hence the self-forged name "input-scaling". Except for the well-known implementation for car-like vehicles, we also offer a self-derived implementation for unicycles (tested on a differential and a skid-steered platform), and a self-derived implementation for bi-steerable vehicles.
