/**
 * @brief Track obstacles on the path.
 *
 * The tracking algorithm (implemented in update()) is quite simple:
 * Input: New observation (= list of detected obstacles)
 *   - Try to match observed obstacles with those that are already tracked (see below, how matching is done).
 *   - Drop tracked obstacles which had no match for a defined duration.
 *   - Add observed obstacles w/o matching partner in the list of currently tracked obstacles as new.
 *
 * Matching:
 *   1) Construct a matrix with all distances between tracked and observed obstacles (observed = rows, tracked = columns)
 *   2) Search the matrix for the pair with the minimal distance. Match this pair.
 *   3) Remove the row and the column, related to the matched obstacles, from the distance matrix.
 *   4) Iterate until distance matrix is empty (= all are matched), or the minimal distance in the remaining matrix is
 *      greater than a defined threshold (-> do not match, if they are to far away from each other).
 *
 * Currently only the center point of an obstacle is used.
